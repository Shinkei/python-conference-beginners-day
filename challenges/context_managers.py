Challenge: context managers

Let's take our decorators challenge from earlier, and say
we want to implement a lock.  Say we're running lots
of my_programs in parallel, and you want to restrict
some functions to only being called once at a time.

Let's say we use a tempfile to hold the lock:
'''
import tempfile
import os

def hold_lock():
    filename = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False).name
    with open(filename, 'w') as f:
        f.write('locked')
    return filename


def release_lock(lock_name):
    os.remove(lock_name)

# esta es la estructura de la clase que se usa como context manager, asi, se asegura que se ejecutara algo antes y despues de la ejecucion de un methodo en este caso, que se pasa como parametro
class ContManLock(object):
    def __init__(self, fun):
        self.lockname = hold_lock()
        self.fun = fun
        print('init, filelock created: %s' % self.lockname)

    def __enter__(self):
        return self.fun

    def __exit__(self, type, val, tb):
        if type is Exception:
            print('\nWARNING THERE WAS AN EXCEPTION')
        release_lock(self.lockname)
        print('lock released')
        return True

'''
Incidentally, you've seen in the Python docs that you're meant
to use "with open" -- that's actually already a context manager.
Building our own might take away some of the air of mystery from it...

So we want to run "hold_lock" before each function starts, and
"release_lock" at the end.

So you could use a decorator, but what if the function
raises an exception?  now you have to have a try/except
and it gets yucky...

You might want to try this to get a feel for the ugliness.

But a context manager would be much nicer!

Find out how to write a context manager that calls hold_lock
before a function runs, and calls release_lock at the end,
even if the function raises an exception.

For bonus points:  make it so that the user can also write
to the lock file, for debugging purposes, when they're
"inside" the context manager...
